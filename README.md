What I'm doing here is playing with some really basic CG and game engine stuff. No specific goals in mind,
I just want to explore the very basics and maybe end up re-creating some classic games. I also want to play
with drawing to the terminal window.

Note that on Windows, some of the terminal drawing doesn't work with the default terminal. But installing 
the "New Windows Terminal" from the Windows store works fine.
